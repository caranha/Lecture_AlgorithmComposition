# Algorithm Composition Talk

## What is this?

This is a 1-hour talk about Evolutionary Computation for optimization,
written by Claus Aranha.

This talk focuses on discussing the problem of how to generate new
algorithms through composition.

The talk begins with a simple explanation of Optimization through EC,
then a digression into the multiplication of algorithms. Then it moves
to the main point about how we need an organized way to generate new
algorithms for specific tasks/domains.

This talk was first given for the Master Course on Evolutionary
Algorithms at the University of Malaga, on 2022/12/15.

## Talk Details
### Title:

Evolutionary Frankenstein: The change in Evolutionary Computation
from `metaphor algorithms` to `component research`

### Abstract:

Evolutionary Algorithms have been effective methods for hard
optimization problems since the 80ies. Their key idea, as the name
indicates, is to use a process that is similar to/inspired by
biological evolution to continuously select ever improving solutions
to a problem. In the same period, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) showed
great success for solving graph search problems by using ideas based
on how ants navigate their environment. Unfortunately, based on the
success of these algorithms, the 2000s have seen a true parade of
works proposing methods inspired by increasingly bizarre metaphors,
such as cats, whales, music, and even zombies. In most cases, these
"metaphor algorithms" differ very little from traditional
meta-heuristic methods, and stake their novelties only in the metaphor
itself. More recently, the field has started to move away from
"creating new algorithms" to "developing components", where each
component is rigorously studied for its capacity to contribute to the
overall search. The search algorithm itself is now created by an
automatic process, that chooses the components that better fit each
target problem.

This talks offers an overview of the above trajectory, explaining
Evolutionary algorithms overall, the initial motivation for creating
new algorithms, the "metaphor craze" era, and the recent push for more
methodical research on meta-heuristics.
